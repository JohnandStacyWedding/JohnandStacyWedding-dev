                            <p>
                                Stacy is most thankful to her parents for raising her in a loving family and for the fond childhood memories of growing up in central Illinois. The dance lessons (ballet and jazz), family camping weekends, and heavy involvement in church, school, and other activities shaped her person in ways she could not have anticipated. Today, she still finds joy in dancing (now swing and contra), camping, board games, and her Christian community. After graduating from Kettering University in Chemical Engineering, Stacy finally left the cold Midwest to obtain a MS in Biomanufacturing in North Carolina, where she was blessed to meet John. Her love for the outdoors has grown immensely since moving to North Carolina: hiking or climbing, s'mores or campfire pepperoni, anything as long as the weather is nice.</p>

                            <p>
                                Originally from Raleigh, NC, John grew up talking pumps, valves, and troubleshooting at the dinner table.  Like his family, he studied engineering, eventually designing automated packaging equipment.  However, John has enjoyed expressing creativity in all forms, from artwork and dance to programming and electronics.  In graduate school, his interests in religious study and board games deepened, and he met Stacy, the love of his life.  Also, he rediscovered a love of the outdoors (experiencing "glamping" probably helped).  John feels fortunate to have had the support and love of his family, especially Jim (his brother), and so many friends along for this journey.</p>

                            <h2>THE BEGINNING</h2>
                            <p>In 2013, John and Stacy started graduate school at NC State University, where they met in a Bible study for graduate students.  For several weeks, John found Stacy laying in the grass on campus and began scheduling his walks to coincide with her siestas.  When Stacy's multicolor pen broke, she asked John to do some engineering magic.  Although he was unable to fix it, he got an assorted set and gave her a replacement in her favorite color.  Stacy was smitten.  After long hours in the library, laughter, and shared beliefs and interests, the connection grew between them.  With graduation, employment separated them geographically, but the roots of their relationship were already planted.  The relationship continued to be cultivated through tens of thousands of miles of driving and many hours of phone calls.  Now, it is blossoming into marriage. </p>

                            <p>John knew he wanted to propose in person, outside near a waterfall.  (Stacy loves waterfalls.)  Their trip to New Hampshire's White Mountains was the perfect opportunity. He proposed on a tree in front of the frozen Arethusa Falls.</p>

                                Mountains are a site of spirituality and beauty for John and Stacy, and who were immediately attracted to Symmes Chapel after seeing pictures.  Before they even started dating, Stacy sent her sister a picture with this email:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                John and I were just chatting about mountain retreat locations [for our Bible study group], and he told me to look up this place. It's called Symmes Chapel and it's only about an hour from where he will be working (in South Carolina) after graduation. We are going to get married there. Just FYI. ;)
